# Design of Car Alarm System

This project implements a car alarm system using digital logic design concepts.
The system monitors four inputs:
- Door closed (D)
- Key inserted (K)
- Driver has license (L)
- Seat belt fastened (B)

An alarm is triggered when unsafe or unauthorized conditions occur.

## Tools & Concepts
- Boolean algebra
- K-map simplification
- Verilog HDL
- FPGA-based digital design

## Inputs and Output
- Inputs: D, K, L, B
- Output: Alarm (A)

## Implementation
The logic is implemented using Verilog and verified using truth tables and logic diagrams.
